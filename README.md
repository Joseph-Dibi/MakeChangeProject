# Make Change Project

## Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

##Add how you built it, what you used, and what you learned.

My program runs by using a single method in the main. That method asks for user input of both the cost of the item they are buying and the amount of money they are using to pay for that item.

More cash than the cost will cause the moneyTendered program to run and deliver change amounts.

Exact values give a message saying that and exit program.

Lesser cash than cost require the user to add at least the exact amount to their intital amount. This can be over the cost of the item resulting in moneyTendered to run.

In this project I learned about using methods within methods to call items. this makes it easier to organize what is running at what time and also cuts down clutter within the main.
I also learned about using math functions and equations to gather desired bill amounts and distribute proper change. I also learned about casting as casting had to be used to both receive proper integer amounts and to also deliver numbers to the screen in a better format.
